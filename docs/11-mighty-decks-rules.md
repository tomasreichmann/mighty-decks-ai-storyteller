# Mighty Decks

_A Fast-Paced Narrative Tabletop RPG_

---

## 1. What Is Mighty Decks?

**Mighty Decks** is a fast-paced tabletop roleplaying game for **1–4 players and one Storyteller**.

Instead of rolling dice to determine success or failure, players use a personal **Outcome Deck**. This allows them to strategically influence when they succeed — and how they fail.

The game focuses on:

- Dramatic storytelling
- Player agency
- Tactical tension
- Minimal bookkeeping

No character sheets required. No complex math. Just cards and story.

---

Counters use dice to track their value.

---

   - Takes an Outcome Deck.
   - Selects 2 Stunts.

   - Counters needed for scenes.

The Storyteller reads the private Storyteller Summary.

---

## 5. Scenes & Tension

An Adventure is divided into **Scenes**.

### 5.1 High Tension Scenes

Combat, moral dilemmas, chases, crises.

Turn-based play may be activated.

### 5.2 Low Tension Scenes

Freeform narrative play.

## 6. How Actions Work

### Step 1: Describe Intent

Player describes what their character does.

### Step 2: Establish Stakes

Storyteller clarifies:

- What happens if you succeed?
- What happens if you fail?

Outcome cards should only be used when:

- There is risk
- There are meaningful consequences

---

### Step 3: Play an Outcome Card

Player selects one card from hand.

Apply the card’s Effect value.

---

### Effect Value Meaning

Effect value determines:

- Progress toward a goal
- Damage dealt
- Intensity of persuasion
- Severity of consequence

The Storyteller interprets Effect value narratively.

---

## 7. Catastrophe Rule

If a player ever holds **3 or more Fumble cards**, immediately:

1. Reveal them.
2. Trigger a Catastrophe.
3. Storyteller narrates a dramatic failure.
4. Player discards hand and redraws 3 cards.

Catastrophes escalate the story.

---
